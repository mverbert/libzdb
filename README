 Introduction
 ------------

 Libzdb is a database library with thread-safe connection pooling. The
 library can connect transparently to multiple database systems. It has
 zero runtime configuration and connection is specified via a URL scheme.


 System requirements
 -------------------

 * Memory and Disk space

   A minimum of 1 megabytes RAM are required and around 500KB of free
   disk space. You may need more RAM depending on how many Connections
   the library should create.

 * C99 Compiler and Build System

   You will need a C99 compiler installed to build the library. The 
   GNU C compiler (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is
   recommended. In addition, your PATH must contain basic build tools
   such as make and flex and database configuration scripts for MySQL
   and PostgreSQL, that is, mysql_config and pg_config respectively. 
   
 * Database systems
 
   This Software supports the following database systems, 
     - MySQL         - version 4.1 or above
     - PostgreSQL    - version 8.0 or above 
     - SQLite        - version 3.0 or above
     - Oracle        - version 10 or above
   Client libraries for at least one of these database systems must
   be installed on the host on which this Software will be built.
 
 
 Installation
 ------------
 
 This library utilize the GNU auto-tools and provided the requirements
 above are satisfied, building the library is conducted via the
 standard;

  ./configure
  make
  make install 
 
 Use ./configure --help for build and install options. By default, the
 library is built with support for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. You may
 change this with the --without-<database> options to ./configure. E.g.
 --without-mysql, --without-postgresql or --without-sqlite
  
 To verify the library and run unit tests, do 'make verify'. You may
 also want to take a look at test/select.c for an example on how to use
 the library.
  
 Note that unit tests cannot be built if the --enable-protected
 configure switch where used. This switch is used to package protect
 non-API objects in the library. It is strongly recommended to build the
 library with --enable-protected as it will be faster and reduce the risk
 for name symbol interposing


 API Documentation
 -----------------
 
 The directory doc/api-docs/ and index.html contains the full API
 documentation for the library, generated by Doxygen. Start by reading
 the documentation for ConnectionPool.h
  

 Exceptions handling
 -------------------
 
 The library implements an elegant solution for thread-safe exceptions
 handling. Use of exceptions frees programmers from the tedious return
 code idiom for dealing with errors. The API documents every method that
 can throw an exception. Methods that can throw an exception should be
 called from inside a try-block.
  

 Link and include
 ----------------
 
 Clients may use the following meta interface to include libzdb API
 interfaces;
 
 #include <zdb.h>
 
 Alternatively, libzdb API interfaces can be included separately
 as needed.

 Compile and link with libzdb;

 gcc -o select select.c -L/<prefix>/lib -lzdb -I/<prefix>/include/zdb
 
 On some systems you may have to explicit link with -lpthread and
 set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if libzdb was installed in a non-standard location
 
 Libzdb can be used directly in a C++ or in a Objective-C(++) project. The 
 <zdb.h> header contains the 'extern "C"' statement which is required when
 importing C declarations into C++ code and linking with a C library.
