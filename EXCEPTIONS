                Tildeslash License Exception

Exception Intent
================

We want Open Source Software applications to be able to use the
GNU General Public Licensed Zild Database Library (the `Library') 
despite the fact that not all Open Source licenses are compatible
with version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the `GPL'). 

Legal Terms and Conditions 
==========================

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 
3.0 of the GPL

1.  You are free to distribute the Library and link the Library
    with Work licensed under one or more of the Open Source 
    licenses listed below in section 2, as long as:

 a) You obey the GPL in all respects for the Library and the Work, 
    except for identifiable sections of the Work which are not 
    derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be 
    considered independent and separate works in themselves,

 b) All identifiable sections of the Work which are not derived
    from the Library, and which can reasonably be considered
    independent and separate works in themselves,

    i)  are distributed subject to one of the Open Source
        licenses listed below, and
    
    ii) the object code or executable form of those sections are
        accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-
        readable source code for those sections on the same
        medium and under the same Open Source license as the
        corresponding object code or executable forms of those
        sections.

If the above conditions are not met, then the Library may only 
be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and 
conditions of the GPL version 3.
